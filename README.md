# The Car Battery Problem
The problem:
Starting off with <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=n" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n" title="n" /></a> number of batteries in a pile. A battery powered car can use one for its engines and carry a spare. Assuming the batteries to be of exactly identical capacity, the mileage of the car per battery is $k$ kilometers.

The Question:
What is the maximum distance that the car can travel given $n$ number of batteries in the pile initially? The problem must be solved recursively. Provide as much explanation as possible.
