The problem:
Starting off with $n$ number of batteries in a pile. A battery powered car can use one for its engines and carry a spare. Assuming the batteries to be of exactly identical capacity, the mileage of the car per battery is $k$ kilometers.

The Question:
What is the maximum distance that the car can travel given $n$ number of batteries in the pile initially? The problem must be solved recursively. Provide as much explanation as possible.
